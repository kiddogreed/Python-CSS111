#Variable Scope
"""The scope of a variable determines how long that variable exists and where it can be used. Within a Python program, there are two categories of scope: local and global. A variable has local scope when it is defined (assigned a value) inside a function. A variable has global scope when it is defined outside of all functions. Here is a small Python program that has two variables: g and x. g is defined outside of all functions and therefore has global scope. x is defined inside the main function and therefore has local scope."""
